# tess-two

A fork of Tesseract Tools for Android 
([tesseract-android-tools][tesseract-android-tools]) that adds some
additional functions. Tesseract Tools for Android is a set of Android APIs and
build files for the [Tesseract OCR][tesseract-ocr] and [Leptonica][leptonica] 
image processing libraries.

This project works with Tesseract pre-release v3.04 and Leptonica v1.72. The 
required source code for Tesseract and Leptonica is included within the 
`tess-two/jni` folder.

The `tess-two` subdirectory contains tools for compiling the Tesseract and 
Leptonica libraries for use on the Android platform. It contains an Android 
[library project][library-project] that provides a Java API for accessing 
natively-compiled Tesseract and Leptonica APIs.

The `eyes-two` subdirectory contains a second, separate library project with 
additional image processing code copied from the [eyes-free project][eyes-free].
It includes native functions for text detection, blur detection, optical flow 
detection, and thresholding. Building eyes-two is not necessary for using the 
Tesseract or Leptonica APIs.

The `tess-two-test` subdirectory contains Android JUnit tests.

## Pre-requisites

* Android 2.2 or higher
* A v3.02 [trained data file][tessdata] for a language. Data files must be 
extracted to the Android device in a subdirectory named `tessdata`.

## Versions

Release points are tagged with [version numbers][semantic-versioning]. A change 
to the major version number indicates an API change making that version 
incompatible with previous versions.

## Building

This project is set up to build on Android SDK Tools r22.3+ and Android NDK 
r10d+. The build works on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows 7/8. See [Issues][issues]
for reported build issues.

On 64-bit Ubuntu, you may need to install the `ia32-libs` 32-bit compatibility 
library.

In windows, you may need to add the argument '--target android-22' to 'android update project --path .'.
Use 'android list targets' to see which are available.
Add android as an alias with 'doskey android=C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\tools\android.bat $*'.

To build the latest tess-two code, run the following commands in the terminal:

    git clone git://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two tess
    cd tess
    cd tess-two
    ndk-build
    android update project --path .
    ant release


To build eyes-two, additionally run the following:

    cd ..
    cd eyes-two
    ndk-build
    android update project --path .
    ant release

After building, the tess-two and eyes-two projects can be imported into Eclipse 
using File->Import->Existing Projects into Workspace.

## Maven

While this project does not require Maven (and this project has not yet been 
registered in a Maven central repository), it can be 
[integrated into a local Maven repository for convenience][maven].

## ProGuard
If you're using ProGuard for code shrinking and obfuscation, add the following
to your app's ProGuard config to retain fields used for sharing data with native
code:
```proguard
# tess-two
-keep class com.googlecode.leptonica.android.Box {
    private long mNativeBox;
}
-keep class com.googlecode.leptonica.android.Boxa {
    private long mNativeBoxa;
}
-keep class com.googlecode.leptonica.android.Pix {
    private long mNativePix;
}
-keep class com.googlecode.leptonica.android.Pixa {
    private long mNativePixa;
}
-keep class com.googlecode.tesseract.android.TessBaseAPI {
    private long mNativeData;
}
-keep class com.googlecode.tesseract.android.PageIterator {
    private long mNativePageIterator;
}
-keep class com.googlecode.tesseract.android.ResultIterator {
    private long mNativeResultIterator;
}
```

```proguard
# eyes-two
-keep class com.googlecode.eyesfree.textdetect.HydrogenTextDetector {
    private long mNative;
}
```
