# About

This package contains an OCR engine - `libtesseract` and a command line program - `tesseract`.

The lead developer is Ray Smith. The maintainer is Zdenko Podobny. 
For a list of contributors see [AUTHORS](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/AUTHORS)
and GitHub's log of [contributors](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/graphs/contributors).

Tesseract has unicode (UTF-8) support, and can recognize more than 100
languages "out of the box". It can be trained to recognize other languages. See [Tesseract Training](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/TrainingTesseract) for more information. 

Tesseract supports various output formats: plain-text, hocr(html), pdf.

This project does not include a GUI application. If you need one, please see the [3rdParty](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/User-Projects-%E2%80%93-3rdParty) wiki page.

You should note that in many cases, in order to get better OCR results, you'll need to [improve the quality](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/ImproveQuality) of the image you are giving Tesseract.

The latest stable version is 3.04.01, released in February 2016.

# Brief history

Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories Bristol and
at Hewlett-Packard Co, Greeley Colorado between 1985 and 1994, with some
more changes made in 1996 to port to Windows, and some C++izing in 1998.

In 2005 Tesseract was open sourced by HP. Since 2006 it is developed by Google.

# For developers

Developers can use `libtesseract` [C](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/capi.h) or [C++](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/baseapi.h) API to build their own application. If you need bindings to `libtesseract` for other programming languages, please see the [wrapper](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/AddOns#tesseract-wrappers) section on AddOns wiki page.

Documentation of Tesseract generated from source code by doxygen can be found on [tesseract-ocr.github.io](http://tesseract-ocr.github.io/).
