// A simple class to provide a dynamic programming solution to a class of
// 1st-order problems in which the cost is dependent only on the current
// step and the best cost to that step, with a possible special case
// of using the variance of the steps, and only the top choice is required.
// Useful for problems such as finding the optimal cut points in a fixed-pitch
// (vertical or horizontal) situation.
// Skeletal Example:
// DPPoint* array = new DPPoint[width];
// for (int i = 0; i < width; i++) {
//   array[i].AddLocalCost(cost_at_i)
// }
// DPPoint* best_end = DPPoint::Solve(..., array);
// while (best_end != NULL) {
//   int cut_index = best_end - array;
//   best_end = best_end->best_prev();
// }
// delete [] array;
