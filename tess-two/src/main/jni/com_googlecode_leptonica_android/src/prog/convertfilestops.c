/*
 * convertfilestops.c
 *
 *    Converts all files in the given directory with matching substring
 *    to a level 3 compressed PostScript file, at the specified resolution.
 *    To convert all files in the directory, use 'allfiles' for the substring.
 *
 *    See below for syntax and usage.
 *
 *    To generate a ps that scales the images to fit a standard 8.5 x 11
 *    page, use res = 0.
 *
 *    Otherwise, this will convert based on a specified input resolution.
 *    Decreasing the input resolution will cause the image to be rendered
 *    larger, and v.v.   For example, if the page was originally scanned
 *    at 400 ppi and you use 300 ppi for the resolution, the page will
 *    be rendered with larger pixels (i.e., be magnified) and you will
 *    lose a quarter of the page on the right side and a quarter
 *    at the bottom.
