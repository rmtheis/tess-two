/*
 * convertsegfilestops.c
 *
 *    Converts all image files in a 'page' directory, using optional
 *    corresponding segmentation mask files in a 'mask' directory,
 *    to a level 2 compressed PostScript file.  This is done
 *    automatically at a resolution that fits to a letter-sized
 *    (8.5 x 11) inch page.  The 'page' and 'mask' files are paired
 *    by having the same number embedded in their name.
 *    The 'numpre' and 'numpost' args specify the number of
 *    characters at the beginning and end of the filename (not
 *    counting any extension) that are NOT part of the page number.
 *    For example, if the page numbers are 00000.jpg, 00001.jpg, ...
 *    then numpre = numpost = 0.
 *
 *    The mask directory must exist, but it does not need to have
 *    any image mask files.
 *
 *    The pages are taken in lexical order of the filenames.  Therefore,
 *    the embedded numbers should be 0-padded on the left up to
 *    a fixed number of digits.
 *
 *    PostScript (and pdf) allow regions of the image to be encoded
 *    differently.  Regions can be over-written, with the last writing
 *    determining the final output.  Black "ink" can also be written
 *    through a mask that is given by a 1 bpp image.
 *
 *    The page images are typically grayscale or color.  To take advantage
 *    of this depth, one typically upscales the text by 2.0.  Likewise,
 *    the images regions, denoted by foreground in the corresponding
 *    segmentation mask, can be rendered at lower resolution, and
 *    it is often useful to downscale the image parts by 0.5.
 *
 *    If the mask does not exist, the entire page is interpreted as
 *    text; it is converted to 1 bpp and written to file with
 *    ccitt-g4 compression at the requested "textscale" relative
 *    to the page image.   If the mask exists and the foreground
 *    covers the entire page, the entire page is saved with jpeg
 *    ("dct") compression at the requested "imagescale".
 *    If the mask exists and partially covers the page image, the
 *    page is saved as a mixture of grayscale or rgb dct and 1 bpp g4.
 *
 *    This uses a single global threshold for binarizing the text
 *    (i.e., non-image) regions of every page.
