/*
 * converttopdf.c
 *
 *    Bundles all image files that are in the designated directory, with
 *    optional matching substring, into a pdf.
 *
 *    The encoding type depends on the input file format:
 *      jpeg     ==>  DCT (not transcoded)
 *      jp2k     ==>  JPX (not transcoded)
 *      tiff-g4  ==>  G4
 *      png      ==>  FLATE (not transcoded)
 *    The default resolution is set at 300 ppi if not given in the
 *    individual images, and the images are wrapped at full resolution.
 *    No title is attached.
 *
 *    This is meant for the simplest set of input arguments.  It is
 *    very fast for jpeg, jp2k and png.
 *    The syntax for using all files in the directory is:
 *         convertopdf <pdf_outfile>
 *    The syntax using some substring to be matched in the file names is:
 *         converttopdf <substring> <pdf_outfile>
 *    If you want something more general, use convertfilestopdf.
