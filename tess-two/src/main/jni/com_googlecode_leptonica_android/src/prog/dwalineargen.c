/*
 * dwalineargen.c
 *
 *   This generates the C code for the full set of linear Sels,
 *   for dilation, erosion, opening and closing, and for both
 *   horizontal and vertical operations, from length 2 to 63.
 *
 *   These are put in files:
 *        dwalinear.3.c
 *        dwalinearlow.3.c
 *
 *   Q. Why is this C code generated here in prog, and not placed
 *      in the library where it can be linked in with all programs?
 *   A. Because the two files it generates have 17K lines of code!
 *      We also make this code available here ("out of the box") so that you
 *      can build and run dwamorph1_reg and dwamorph2_reg, without
 *      first building and running dwalineargen.c
 *
 *   Q. Why do we build code for operations up to 63 in width and height?
 *   A. Atomic DWA operations work on Sels that have hits and misses
 *      that are not larger than 31 pixel positions from the origin.
 *      Thus, they can implement a horizontal closing up to 63 pixels
 *      wide if the origin is in the center.
 *
 *      Note the word "atomic".  DWA operations can be done on arbitrarily
 *      large Sels using the *ExtendDwa() functions.  See morphdwa.c
 *      for details.
