/*
 * fmorphautogen.c
 *
 *    This program is used to generate the two files.
 *    If filename is not given, the files are:
 *         fmorphgen.<n>.c
 *         fmorphgenlow.<n>.c
 *    where <n> is the input index.  Otherwise they are:
 *         <filename>.<n>.c
 *         <filename>low.<n>.c
 *    These two files, when compiled, implement dwa operations for
 *    all sels generated by selaAddBasic().
 *
 *    The library files fmorphgen.1.c and fmorphgenlow.1.c
 *    were made using index = 1.
