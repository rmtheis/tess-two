%    gplotdata.example
%
% This is an example data file to be used as input for gplot
% from file.
%
% All lines starting with '%' are comments and are ignored
% All blank lines are ignored
% Use '&' at beginning of a line as a control character:
%   The first '&' signals that the data is to start
%   Subsequent '&' are separators between data for different plots;
%   this way, we can have multiple plots on the same output graph
%
% All plot info lines before the "&" that signals start of 
% data are optional
%
% If they exist, the first three must be:
%       title
%       xaxis label
%       yaxis label
% These default to null strings.
%
% Optionally after that, the individual plots can
% be labeled and the drawing method specified.
% This is done by specifying:
%       number of plots
%       title for plot 1
%       drawing style for plot 1
%       title for plot 2
%       drawing style for plot 2
%       ...
% 
% The defaults are to have the plots untitled and to
% use LINES for the plot.  The drawing styles allowed
% are in the set {LINES, POINTS, IMPULSES, LINESPOINTS, DOTS}.
%      

this is the title
this is the xaxis label
this is the yaxis label
