 *  pixCorrelationScore()
 *
 *      Input:  pix1   (test pix, 1 bpp)
 *              pix2   (exemplar pix, 1 bpp)
 *              area1  (number of on pixels in pix1)
 *              area2  (number of on pixels in pix2)
 *              delx   (x comp of centroid difference)
 *              dely   (y comp of centroid difference)
 *              maxdiffw (max width difference of pix1 and pix2)
 *              maxdiffh (max height difference of pix1 and pix2)
 *              tab    (sum tab for byte)
 *              &score (<return> correlation score)
 *      Return: 0 if OK, 1 on error
 *
 *  Note: we check first that the two pix are roughly the same size.
 *  For jbclass (jbig2) applications at roughly 300 ppi, maxdiffw and
 *  maxdiffh should be at least 2.
 *
 *  Only if they meet that criterion do we compare the bitmaps.
 *  The centroid difference is used to align the two images to the
 *  nearest integer for the correlation.
 *
 *  The correlation score is the ratio of the square of the number of
 *  pixels in the AND of the two bitmaps to the product of the number
 *  of ON pixels in each.  Denote the number of ON pixels in pix1
 *  by |1|, the number in pix2 by |2|, and the number in the AND
 *  of pix1 and pix2 by |1 & 2|.  The correlation score is then
 *  (|1 & 2|)**2 / (|1|*|2|).
 *
 *  This score is compared with an input threshold, which can
 *  be modified depending on the weight of the template.
 *  The modified threshold is
 *     thresh + (1.0 - thresh) * weight * R
 *  where
 *     weight is a fixed input factor between 0.0 and 1.0
 *     R = |2| / area(2)
 *  and area(2) is the total number of pixels in 2 (i.e., width x height).
 *
 *  To understand why a weight factor is useful, consider what happens
 *  with thick, sans-serif characters that look similar and have a value
 *  of R near 1.  Different characters can have a high correlation value,
 *  and the classifier will make incorrect substitutions.  The weight
 *  factor raises the threshold for these characters.
 *
 *  Yet another approach to reduce such substitutions is to run the classifier
 *  in a non-greedy way, matching to the template with the highest
 *  score, not the first template with a score satisfying the matching
 *  constraint.  However, this is not particularly effective.
 *
 *  The implementation here gives the same result as in
 *  pixCorrelationScoreSimple(), where a temporary Pix is made to hold
 *  the AND and implementation uses rasterop:
 *      pixt = pixCreateTemplate(pix1);
 *      pixRasterop(pixt, idelx, idely, wt, ht, PIX_SRC, pix2, 0, 0);
 *      pixRasterop(pixt, 0, 0, wi, hi, PIX_SRC & PIX_DST, pix1, 0, 0);
 *      pixCountPixels(pixt, &count, tab);
 *      pixDestroy(&pixt);
 *  However, here it is done in a streaming fashion, counting as it goes,
 *  and touching memory exactly once, giving a 3-4x speedup over the
 *  simple implementation.  This very fast correlation matcher was
 *  contributed by William Rucklidge.

 *      Input:  pix1   (test pix, 1 bpp)
 *              pix2   (exemplar pix, 1 bpp)
 *              area1  (number of on pixels in pix1)
 *              area2  (number of on pixels in pix2)

 *              maxdiffw (max width difference of pix1 and pix2)
 *              maxdiffh (max height difference of pix1 and pix2)
 *              tab    (sum tab for byte)
 *              downcount (count of 1 pixels below each row of pix1)
 *              score_threshold
 *      Return: whether the correlation score is >= score_threshold
 *
 *
 *  Note: we check first that the two pix are roughly the same size.
 *  Only if they meet that criterion do we compare the bitmaps.
 *  The centroid difference is used to align the two images to the
 *  nearest integer for the correlation.
 *
 *  The correlation score is the ratio of the square of the number of
 *  pixels in the AND of the two bitmaps to the product of the number
 *  of ON pixels in each.  Denote the number of ON pixels in pix1
 *  by |1|, the number in pix2 by |2|, and the number in the AND
 *  of pix1 and pix2 by |1 & 2|.  The correlation score is then
 *  (|1 & 2|)**2 / (|1|*|2|).
 *
 *  This score is compared with an input threshold, which can
 *  be modified depending on the weight of the template.
 *  The modified threshold is
 *     thresh + (1.0 - thresh) * weight * R
 *  where
 *     weight is a fixed input factor between 0.0 and 1.0
 *     R = |2| / area(2)
 *  and area(2) is the total number of pixels in 2 (i.e., width x height).
 *
 *  To understand why a weight factor is useful, consider what happens
 *  with thick, sans-serif characters that look similar and have a value
 *  of R near 1.  Different characters can have a high correlation value,
 *  and the classifier will make incorrect substitutions.  The weight
 *  factor raises the threshold for these characters.
 *
 *  Yet another approach to reduce such substitutions is to run the classifier
 *  in a non-greedy way, matching to the template with the highest
 *  score, not the first template with a score satisfying the matching
 *  constraint.  However, this is not particularly effective.
 *
 *  This very fast correlation matcher was contributed by William Rucklidge.

 *      (2) This is implemented by starting with a copy of pix1 and

 *      (3) Get the pixel counts for area1 and area2 using piCountPixels().
 *      (4) A good estimate for a shift that would maximize the correlation
 *          is to align the centroids (cx1, cy1; cx2, cy2), giving the
 *          relative translations etransx and etransy:
 *             etransx = cx1 - cx2
 *             etransy = cy1 - cy2
 *          Typically delx is chosen to be near etransx; ditto for dely.
 *          This function is used in pixBestCorrelation(), where the
 *          translations delx and dely are varied to find the best alignment.
 *      (5) We do not check the sizes of pix1 and pix2, because they should
 *          be comparable.
