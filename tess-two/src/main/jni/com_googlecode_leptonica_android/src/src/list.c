 *
 *      Lists are much harder to handle than arrays.  There is
 *      more overhead for the programmer, both cognitive and
 *      codewise, and more likelihood that an error can be made.
 *      For that reason, lists should only be used when it is
 *      inefficient to use arrays, such as when elements are
 *      routinely inserted or deleted from inside arrays whose
 *      average size is greater than about 10.
 *
 *      A list of data structures can be implemented in a number
 *      of ways.  The two most popular are:
 *
 *         (1) The list can be composed of a linked list of
 *             pointer cells ("cons cells"), where the data structures
 *             are hung off the cells.  This is more difficult
 *             to use because you have to keep track of both
 *             your hanging data and the cell structures.
 *             It requires 3 pointers for every data structure
 *             that is put in a list.  There is no problem
 *             cloning (using reference counts) for structures that
 *             are put in such a list.  We implement lists by this
 *             method here.
 *
 *         (2) The list pointers can be inserted directly into
 *             the data structures.  This is easy to implement
 *             and easier to use, but it adds 2 ptrs of overhead
 *             to every data structure in which the ptrs are embedded.
 *             It also requires special care not to put the ptrs
 *             in any data that is cloned with a reference count;
 *             else your lists will break.
 *
 *      Writing C code that uses list pointers explicitly to make
 *      and alter lists is difficult and prone to error.
 *      Consequently, a generic list utility that handles lists
 *      of arbitrary objects and doesn't force the programmer to
 *      touch the "next" and "prev" pointers, is quite useful.
 *      Such functions are provided here.   However, the usual
 *      situation requires traversing a list and applying some
 *      function to one or more of the list elements.  Macros
 *      for traversing the list are, in general, necessary, to
 *      achieve the goal of invisibly handling all "next" and "prev"
 *      pointers in generic lists.  We provide macros for
 *      traversing a list in both forward and reverse directions.
 *
 *      Because of the typing in C, implementation of a general
 *      list utility requires casting.  If macros are used, the
 *      casting can be done implicitly; otherwise, using functions,
 *      some of the casts must be explicit.  Fortunately, this
 *      can be implemented with void* so the programmer using
 *      the library will not have to make any casts!  (Unless you
 *      compile with g++, in which case the rules on implicit
 *      conversion are more strict.)
 *
 *      For example, to add an arbitrary data structure foo to the
 *      tail of a list, use
 *             listAddToTail(&head, &tail, pfoo);
 *      where head and tail are list cell ptrs and pfoo is
 *      a pointer to the foo object.
 *      And to remove an arbitrary data structure foo from a
 *      list, when you know the list cell element it is hanging from,
 *      use
 *             pfoo = listRemoveElement(&head, elem)
 *      where head and elem are list cell ptrs and pfoo is a pointer
 *      to the foo object.  No casts are required for foo in
 *      either direction in ANSI C.  (However, casts are
 *      required for ANSI C++).
 *
 *      We use lists that are composed of doubly-linked
 *      cells with data structures hanging off the cells.
 *      We use doubly-linked cells to simplify insertion
 *      and deletion, and to allow operations to proceed in either
 *      direction along the list.  With doubly-linked lists,
 *      it is tempting to make them circular, by setting head->prev
 *      to the tail of the list and tail->next to the head.
 *      The circular list costs nothing extra in storage, and
 *      allows operations to proceed from either end of the list
 *      with equal speed.  However, the circular link adds
 *      cognitive overhead for the application programmer in
 *      general, and it greatly complicates list traversal when
 *      arbitrary list elements can be added or removed as you
 *      move through.  It can be done, but in the spirit of
 *      simplicity, we avoid the temptation.  The price to be paid
 *      is the extra cost to find the tail of a list -- a full
 *      traversal -- before the tail can be used.  This is a
 *      cheap price to pay to avoid major headaches and buggy code.
 *
 *      When you are only applying some function to each element
 *      in a list, you can go either forwards or backwards.
 *      To run through a list forwards, use:
 *
 *          for (elem = head; elem; elem = nextelem) {
 *              nextelem = elem->next;   (in case we destroy elem)
 *              <do something with elem->data>
 *          }
 *
 *      To run through a list backwards, find the tail and use:
 *
 *          for (elem = tail; elem; elem = prevelem) {
 #              prevelem = elem->prev;  (in case we destroy elem)
 *              <do something with elem->data>
 *          }
 *
 *      Even though these patterns are very simple, they are so common
 *      that we've provided macros for them in list.h.  Using the
 *      macros, this becomes:
 *
 *          L_BEGIN_LIST_FORWARD(head, elem)
 *              <do something with elem->data>
 *          L_END_LIST
 *
 *          L_BEGIN_LIST_REVERSE(tail, elem)
 *              <do something with elem->data>
 *          L_END_LIST
 *
 *      Note again that with macros, the application programmer does
 *      not need to refer explicitly to next and prev fields.  Also,
 *      in the reverse case, note that we do not explicitly
 *      show the head of the list.  However, the head of the list
 *      is always in scope, and functions can be called within the
 *      iterator that change the head.
 *
 *      Some special cases are simpler.  For example, when
 *      removing all items from the head of the list, you can use
 *
 *          while (head) {
 *              obj = listRemoveFromHead(&head);
 *              <do something with obj>
 *          }
 *
 *      Removing successive elements from the tail is equally simple:
 *
 *          while (tail) {
 *              obj = listRemoveFromTail(&head, &tail);
 *              <do something with obj>
 *          }
 *
 *      When removing an arbitrary element from a list, use
 *
 *              obj = listRemoveElement(&head, elem);
 *
 *      All the listRemove*() functions hand you the object,
 *      destroy the list cell to which it was attached, and
 *      reset the list pointers if necessary.
 *
 *      Several other list operations, that do not involve
 *      inserting or removing objects, are also provided.
 *      The function listFindElement() locates a list pointer
 *      by matching the object hanging on it to a given
 *      object.  The function listFindTail() gets a handle
 *      to the tail list ptr, allowing backwards traversals of
 *      the list.  listGetCount() gives the number of elements
 *      in a list.  Functions that reverse a list and concatenate
 *      two lists are also provided.
 *
 *      These functions can be modified for efficiency in the
 *      situation where there is a large amount of creation and
 *      destruction of list cells.  If millions of cells are
 *      made and destroyed, but a relatively small number are
 *      around at any time, the list cells can be stored for
 *      later re-use in a stack (see the generic stack functions
 *      in stack.c).

 *          which case  the tail is found and updated, and the

 *      (3) In ANSI C, it is not necessary to cast return to actual type; e.g.,
 *            pix = listRemoveFromTail(&head, &tail);
 *          but in ANSI C++, it is necessary to do the cast; e.g.,
