 * EANYCODE_CHAR
 * Description of a single character. The character code is defined by
 * the character set of the current font.
 * Output text is sent as an array of these structures.
 * Spaces and line endings in the output are represented in the
 * structures of the surrounding characters. They are not directly
 * represented as characters.
 * The first character in a word has a positive value of blanks.
 * Missing information should be set to the defaults in the comments.
 * If word bounds are known, but not character bounds, then the top and
 * bottom of each character should be those of the word. The left of the
 * first and right of the last char in each word should be set. All other
 * lefts and rights should be set to -1.
 * If set, the values of right and bottom are left+width and top+height.
 * Most of the members come directly from the parameters to ocr_append_char.
 * The formatting member uses the enhancement parameter and combines the
 * line direction stuff into the top 3 bits.
 * The coding is 0=RL char, 1=LR char, 2=DR NL, 3=UL NL, 4=DR Para,
 * 5=UL Para, 6=TB char, 7=BT char. API users do not need to know what
 * the coding is, only that it is backwards compatible with the previous
 * version.

 * ETEXT_DESC
 * Description of the output of the OCR engine.
 * This structure is used as both a progress monitor and the final
 * output header, since it needs to be a valid progress monitor while
 * the OCR engine is storing its output to shared memory.
 * During progress, all the buffer info is -1.
 * Progress starts at 0 and increases to 100 during OCR. No other constraint.
 * Every progress callback, the OCR engine must set ocr_alive to 1.
 * The HP side will set ocr_alive to 0. Repeated failure to reset
 * to 1 indicates that the OCR engine is dead.
 * If the cancel function is not null then it is called with the number of
 * user words found. If it returns true then operation is cancelled.
