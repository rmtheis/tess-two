NAME
----
mftraining - feature training for Tesseract

SYNOPSIS
--------
mftraining -U 'unicharset' -O 'lang.unicharset' 'FILE'...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
mftraining takes a list of .tr files, from which it generates the
files *inttemp* (the shape prototypes), *shapetable*, and *pffmtable*
(the number of expected features for each character).  (A fourth file
called Microfeat is also written by this program, but it is not used.)

OPTIONS
-------
-U 'FILE'::
	(Input) The unicharset generated by unicharset_extractor(1)

-F 'font_properties_file'::
	(Input) font properties file, each line is of the following form, where each field other than the font name is 0 or 1:
	
	*font_name* *italic* *bold* *fixed_pitch* *serif* *fraktur*

-X 'xheights_file'::
	(Input) x heights file, each line is of the following form, where xheight is calculated as the pixel x height of a character drawn at 32pt on 300 dpi. [ That is, if base x height + ascenders + descenders = 133, how much is x height? ]
	
	*font_name* *xheight*

-D 'dir'::
	Directory to write output files to.

-O 'FILE'::
	(Output) The output unicharset that will be given to combine_tessdata(1)
