.SH "NAME"
unicharambigs \- Tesseract unicharset ambiguities
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The unicharambigs file (a component of traineddata, see combine_tessdata(1) ) is used by Tesseract to represent possible ambiguities between characters, or groups of characters\&.
.sp
The file contains a number of lines, laid out as follow:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[num] <TAB> [char(s)] <TAB> [num] <TAB> [char(s)] <TAB> [num]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.TS

contains either 1 or 0\&. 1 denotes a mandatory replacement, 0 denotes an optional replacement\&.
T}

.sp 1
.sp
Characters appearing in fields two and four should appear in unicharset\&. The numbers in fields one and three refer to the number of unichars (not bytes)\&.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
2       \*(Aq \*(Aq     1       "     1
1       m       2       r n   0
3       i i i   1       m     0
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
In this example, all instances of the \fI2\fR character sequence \fI\*(Aq\fR\*(Aq will \fBalways\fR be replaced by the \fI1\fR character sequence \fI"\fR; a \fI1\fR character sequence \fIm\fR \fBmay\fR be replaced by the \fI2\fR character sequence \fIrn\fR, and the \fI3\fR character sequence \fBmay\fR be replaced by the \fI1\fR character sequence \fIm\fR\&.
.SH "HISTORY"
.sp
The unicharambigs file first appeared in Tesseract 3\&.00; prior to that, a similar format, called DangAmbigs (\fIdangerous ambiguities\fR) was used: the format was almost identical, except only mandatory replacements could be specified, and field 5 was absent\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
This is a documentation "bug": it\(cqs not currently clear what should be done in the case of ligatures (such as \fIfi\fR) which may also appear as regular letters in the unicharset\&.

.SH "AUTHOR"
.sp
The Tesseract OCR engine was written by Ray Smith and his research groups at Hewlett Packard (1985\-1995) and Google (2006\-present)\&.
